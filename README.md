This project was built on Wine Quality dataset collected from INSAID Github profile. This dataset contains 12 features which are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. In this project I did Exploratory Data Analysis on Wine Quality data using the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn  

I did Visualisation using plot. There are several types of plots are available but I used only a few of them. which are listed as follows:

- Countplot
- Boxplot
- Distplot
- Heatmap
- Pair plot

This project was created as a part of the INSAID project to do Exploratory Data Analysis on Wine Quality dataset to know your data before you use it to train your model with it.
